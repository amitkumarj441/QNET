r"""
Constant algebraic objects are best implemented as singletons (i.e., they only
exist as a single object). This module provides the means to declare
singletons:

* The :class:`Singleton` metaclass ensures that every class based on it
  produces the same object every time it is instantiated
* The :func:`singleton_object` class decorator returns a singleton class
  definition with the actual singleton object

Singletons in QNET should use both of these.

    hashable, and has the correct string representation (the name of the
